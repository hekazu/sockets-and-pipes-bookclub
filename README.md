# Sockets and Pipes Book/Exercise Repo

In this repository I follow through the exercises in Chris Martin's book
Sockets and Pipes. I will also fill in most of the book, skipping things
with more value where shown as an example rather than actually used in
projects proper.

Little of the work here is original, and as was said I am not the book's
author. I do take responsibility of the Nix configurations though. Those
did not come with the book.

Done as part of Helsinki Haskell Users Book Club
